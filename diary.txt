So far the plan is to look for places that have a high income relative to
their cost of living. We will use median home price as a proxy for cost of 
living

so far...

I will scrape median incomes by county from
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_counties_by_per_capita_income#cite_note-1

I will scrape median home prices by county from
https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/housing-statistics/county-median-home-prices-and-monthly-mortgage-payment

They only have the data stored in the form of a pdf. so I will use tabula
to liberate the data from the pdf into a csv.


I have made a heat map of the ratio of median house prices to income.
in order to do this I needed to scrape data from
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_FIPS_codes_by_county
in order to get county codes

Then I needed a template I used a template found at
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/US_county_map%2C_blank%2C_w_territories.svg

The final result is in the folder
